# How to contribute

As with any open source effort, there are numerous different ways you can contribute. From fixing a typo to suggesting entirely new content, all suggestions are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

* If you're fixing something without changing the meaning (e.g. fixing a broken link or a typo), please submit a [PR](https://github.com/EqualExperts/secure-delivery-playbook/pulls).
* If you'd like to suggest a change in content (e.g. adding a new section, or changing the meaning of existing text), please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/EqualExperts/secure-delivery-playbook/issues) where we can discuss your proposal. Please do not submit a PR until the changes have been agreed.
