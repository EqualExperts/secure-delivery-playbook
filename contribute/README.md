# Contribute

This playbook is produced through the efforts of [a number of people](contributors.md), all of whom have generously shared their experience for the benefit of others.

Guides like this are never complete. There will always be improvements we can make and as more teams use these practices in a wider variety of contexts - some of which we may not have envisioned. To help ensure this playbook remains relevant and useful, we welcome contributions from anyone in the wider software engineering community. Please see the [contribution guidelines](how-to-contribute.md) if you're interested in helping out.
